# Workflow-Tools Adoption Guide

A practical guide for teams adopting workflow-tools standards in existing projects.

## 🎯 Adoption Philosophy

**Incremental improvement over big-bang changes.**

Don't try to fix everything at once. Focus on:
1. New code follows standards
2. Modified code gets improved
3. Critical areas get refactored
4. Eventually, full compliance

## 📅 Phased Adoption Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

#### 1. Team Alignment
- [ ] Team reads [Universal Test Naming](../generic/test-naming/universal-principles.md)
- [ ] Team reads [Clean Code Principles](../generic/code-quality/clean-code-principles.md)
- [ ] Discuss and agree on adoption strategy
- [ ] Set up tracking for progress

#### 2. Git Workflow
- [ ] Adopt [Conventional Commits](../git/commits/conventional-commits.md)
- [ ] Implement [Branch Naming](../git/branches/branch-naming.md)
- [ ] Create PR template from [PR Standards](../git/prs/pull-request-standards.md)

#### 3. Development Environment
- [ ] Install linting configurations
- [ ] Set up editor configs
- [ ] Configure git hooks

### Phase 2: New Code Standards (Week 3-4)

#### Rule: All NEW Code Follows Standards
- [ ] New tests use business-focused naming
- [ ] New functions follow size guidelines
- [ ] New commits use conventional format
- [ ] New PRs use template

#### Enforcement
```yaml
# CI check for new files
- name: Check new file standards
  run: |
    # Check test naming in new test files
    # Check function size in new modules
    # Validate commit messages
```

### Phase 3: Active Code Improvement (Week 5-8)

#### Boy Scout Rule
"Leave code better than you found it"

When touching existing code:
- [ ] Rename tests in modified test files
- [ ] Break down large functions you're editing
- [ ] Add missing type definitions
- [ ] Improve error handling

#### Tracking Progress
```bash
# Track test naming adoption
grep -r "should\|Should" --include="*.test.*" | wc -l

# Track function size
find . -name "*.ts" -exec wc -l {} + | sort -n | tail -20

# Track commit compliance
git log --oneline -n 100 | grep -E "^[a-f0-9]+ (feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore)"
```

### Phase 4: Targeted Refactoring (Week 9-12)

#### Identify Critical Areas
1. Most-changed files (high churn)
2. Bug-prone modules
3. Performance bottlenecks
4. Security-sensitive code

#### Refactoring Sprints
- [ ] Dedicate 20% of sprint to standards adoption
- [ ] Focus on one area at a time
- [ ] Ensure test coverage before refactoring
- [ ] Measure improvement

## 🛠️ Migration Patterns

### Test Naming Migration

#### Step 1: Identify Tests to Rename
```bash
# Find tests with "should"
grep -r "it\(.*should" --include="*.test.*" src/

# Find technical test names
grep -r "test.*return\|test.*throw" --include="*.test.*" src/
```

#### Step 2: Systematic Renaming
```javascript
// Before
describe('UserService', () => {
  it('should return user when ID exists', () => {})
  it('should throw error when ID invalid', () => {})
})

// After
describe('User Management', () => {
  it('existing users can be retrieved', () => {})
  it('invalid user requests are rejected', () => {})
})
```

### Code Quality Migration

#### Large Function Breakdown
```javascript
// Before: 200-line function
async function processOrder(order) {
  // validation logic (50 lines)
  // inventory check (40 lines)
  // payment processing (60 lines)
  // notification sending (30 lines)
  // database updates (20 lines)
}

// After: Focused functions
async function processOrder(order) {
  const validatedOrder = validateOrder(order)
  await checkInventory(validatedOrder)
  const payment = await processPayment(validatedOrder)
  await notifyCustomer(validatedOrder, payment)
  await updateDatabase(validatedOrder, payment)
}
```

### Git History Cleanup

#### Commit Message Improvement
```bash
# Before merging feature branch
git rebase -i main

# Reword commits to conventional format
pick abc123 fix bug -> reword to "fix(auth): resolve login timeout"
pick def456 add feature -> reword to "feat(cart): add quantity selector"
```

## 📊 Measuring Success

### Automated Metrics
```javascript
// metrics.js - Run weekly
const metrics = {
  testNaming: countBusinessFocusedTests(),
  functionSize: averageFunctionLength(),
  commitCompliance: conventionalCommitPercentage(),
  prTemplateUsage: prTemplateAdoption(),
  lintingErrors: totalLintViolations()
}

console.log('Week', currentWeek, metrics)
```

### Team Satisfaction
- Weekly retrospective on standards
- Anonymous feedback collection
- Adjustment based on pain points

## 🚧 Common Challenges

### "Too Many Small Functions"
**Solution**: Focus on readability gains. Small functions are easier to:
- Test
- Understand
- Reuse
- Debug

### "Renaming Tests Takes Too Long"
**Solution**: Rename during regular work:
- When fixing a bug, rename the test
- When adding features, improve nearby tests
- Use find-and-replace for common patterns

### "Team Resistance"
**Solution**: 
- Start with willing early adopters
- Share success stories
- Measure and show improvements
- Make it easy with tooling
