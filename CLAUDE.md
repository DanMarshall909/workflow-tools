# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a collection of workflow automation tools and utilities designed to streamline development and operational processes.

## Project Structure

- Root directory contains configuration and documentation files
- Tools and scripts will be organized by function or technology
- Each tool should include its own documentation and usage instructions

## Development Commands

Since this is a fresh repository, specific build/test commands will be added as tools are developed. Common patterns to follow:

- Use standard tooling for each technology (npm/yarn for Node.js, pip for Python, etc.)
- Include linting and formatting configuration for each language used
- Add test scripts following the conventions of each tool's ecosystem

## GitHub Integration

- Repository: https://github.com/DanMarshall909/workflow-tools.git
- Project Board: https://github.com/users/DanMarshall909/projects/3/views/1
- Create issues for new tools and link them to the project board for tracking

## Workflow

- Create branches for new features/tools
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Link commits to project board issues when applicable
- Each tool should be self-contained with clear documentation
